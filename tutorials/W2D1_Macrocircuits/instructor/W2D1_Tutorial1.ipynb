    "The [universal approximator theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) (UAT) guarantees that we can approximate any function arbitrarily well using a shallow network - ie. a network with a single hidden layer. So why do we need depth? The \"catch\" in the UAT is that approximating a complex function with a shallow network can require a very large number of hidden units - ie. the network must be very wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this fact, we'll create a complex function and then attempt to fit it with single-hidden-layer neural networks of different widths. What we'll find is that although the UAT guarantees that sufficiently wide networks can approximate our function, the performance will actually not be very good for our shallow nets of modest width.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to create a complex function is to build a random deep neural network. We then have a teacher network which generates the ground truth outputs, and a student network whose goal is to learn the mapping implemented by the teacher. This approach - unsurprisingly known as the student-teacher setting - is useful for both computational and mathematical study of neural networks, since it gives us complete control of the data generation process. Unlike with real world data, we know the exact distribution of inputs and correct outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will show that depending on the distribution of the weights, a random deep neural network can be either very difficult or very easy to approximate with a shallow network. The \"complexity\" of the function computed by random deep network thus depends crucially on the weight distribution. One can actually understand the boundary between hard and easy cases as a kind of boundary between chaos and non-chaos in a certain dynamical system. We will confirm that on the non-chaotic side, a random deep neural network can be effectively approximated by a shallow net. This demonstration will be based on ideas from the paper\n",

    "One of the reasons that shallow nets cannot fit deep nets in general is that random deep nets, in certain regimes, behave like chaotic systems: each layer can be thought of as a single step of a dynamical system, and the number of layers plays the role of the number of time steps. A deep network therefore effictively subjects its input to long-time chaotic dynamics which are, almost by definition, very difficult to predict accurately. In particular, a *shallow* nets simply cannot capture the complex mapping implemented by deeper networks without resorting to an astronimical number of hidden units.\n",
