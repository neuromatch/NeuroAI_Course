    "\n",
    "### Speeding up training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's discuss the 'allow tf32' settings in PyTorch, which are designed to enhance computational speed at the expense of precision. This setting is particularly relevant for operations involving tensors. PyTorch automatically enables this for CuDNN-based convolution operations to accelerate processing times. However, it's important to note that for matrix multiplication tasks, this option remains disabled by default to maintain higher numerical precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move forward, we'll employ PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) as our primary tools for visualizing data. These techniques are instrumental in reducing the dimensionality of the data, allowing us to observe patterns and relationships that are otherwise difficult to discern in high-dimensional spaces. By visualizing data in this way, we can gain insightful perspectives that are crucial for understanding complex datasets."

    "### What is contrastive learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrastive learning is often referred to as \"self-supervised learning (SSL)\" and has historically been known as \"metric learning.\" The essence of contrastive/metric learning is that instead of outputting a classification one-hot/softmax vector, or a regression value, you directly output a high-dimensional embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example: Given multiple data points from a single class (for example, three photos of you from different viewpoints) and different classes (for example, 10 photos from one or multiple people who are not you), you want the three embeddings from your photos to be closer to each other while being farther away from the ten embeddings from the different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the name \"metric learning,\" where you seek to learn a metric/distance that fits the constraints of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why contrastive learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be immediately obvious why you would want to engage in contrastive/metric learning. Can't you just use a giant 1000-class ImageNet-trained classifier and recognize every image? However, metric learning proves useful when the number of classes is not known ahead of time. For example, if I wanted a network to recognize human faces, there are 7 billion people on this planet, which makes it impossible for you to train a classification network with 7 billion output neurons. Nevertheless, I can train a network that outputs a high-dimensional embedding for each image. Now, given a reference image of a person, your network can decide if the new photo is close to or farther away from the reference image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terms defined and other stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positive pair—This refers to two data points that should be close together in embedding space. For example, two photos of you in different lighting conditions.\n",
    "* Negative pair—This refers to two data points that should be far apart in embedding space. For example, a photo of you versus a photo of a dog (assuming you are not a dog). Note that positive pairs/negative pairs don't have to be images. You could have a picture and the matching text be a positive pair as well. Recent work has also moved to positive pairs defined using an older version of the encoder (Google Momentum contrast or EMA contrastive).\n",
    "* Pretext task—In computer vision, this refers to how you augment images to get positive pairs.\n",
    "Hard positive/negative mining—This refers to a practice where positive/negative pairs where the network struggles are used to train the network with more loss in some way.\n",
    "* InfoNCE—This is one of the most common contrastive losses [1,2,3,4], which was proposed in similar ways multiple times by different authors. It is a cross-entropy loss of classifying the correct positive pair out from a pool of pairs. Note there are variants like MIL-NCE, which allow for multiple positive pairs."

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll start by outlining the network blocks that we plan to incorporate into our model. This involves defining each component as a class in PyTorch, which requires inheriting from the torch.nn.Module class. It's crucial to remember that after defining your class, you must initialize it properly by calling super().__init__(). This step is essential as it ensures that all network sub-modules are registered correctly. Additionally, PyTorch provides several useful functions such as ModuleList, register_parameter, register_module, and register_buffer to help manage these components effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini residual block\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial focus will be on creating a mini_residual block. This block adopts a modern approach to the residual design, featuring a prenormalization step as suggested by Kaiming He. We will also incorporate the LeakyReLU activation function. LeakyReLU is particularly favored in generative adversarial networks (GANs) due to its ability to maintain non-zero gradients, which helps in the training process by avoiding the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full model construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the mini_residual block, we will construct the full model. This model will consist of a series of residual blocks stacked together. In PyTorch, the components of a model are organized in a sequence using nn.Sequential, which executes the blocks from the first to the last. This sequential arrangement simplifies the process of defining forward pass operations, ensuring that data flows through the blocks in the intended order. By stacking these blocks, the model can learn complex patterns from the data, enhancing its predictive performance."

    "Now, let's move on to defining the loss function for our model, using an approach extracted from the PyTorch metric learning package for better clarity. We will be implementing a variant of the InfoNCE loss function, which is widely recognized as one of the most effective contrastive or metric learning losses. It has been prominently used in various models, including OpenAI's CLIP, due to its ability to enhance feature discrimination by contrasting positive pairs against negative pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "InfoNCE typically requires substantial batch sizes—commonly 128 or even larger—to perform optimally. This requirement is due to the need for diverse negative samples in the batch to effectively learn the contrasts. However, large batch sizes can be impractical in resource-constrained settings or when data availability is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we will implement a modified version of InfoNCE as described in the \"Decoupled Contrastive Learning\" paper. This variant adapts the loss to be more suitable for smaller batch sizes by modifying the denominator of the InfoNCE formula. Specifically, it removes the positive example from the denominator, which reduces the computational demand and stabilizes training when fewer examples are available. This adjustment not only makes the loss function more flexible but also maintains robustness in learning discriminative features even with smaller batch sizes."

    "### How is contrastive learning used in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all vision foundation models (DINO and DINOv2, CLIP and all CLIP derivatives including OpenCLIP/EVA-CLIP) are trained using contrastive losses. DINO/v2 is trained on images alone, while CLIP is trained on a combination of images and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "When only images are used, the contrastive learning loss is applied to augmentations of the same image. Examples include crops/flips/rotations of images -- when used in the way, the augmentations are called a \"pretext task\". Typically, augmentations of the same image are treated as instances where the embeddings should be the same. So for example, a network should recognize a photo of you, and a photo of you flipped (or brightness changed, or noise added, or changed to black and white) as a photo of the same person.\n",
    "\n",
    "When images and text are used together as in CLIP, you have images and captions of those images -- for example the caption \"A photo of a dog\" may be matched to a picture of a blue heeler puppy. These captions are typicalled scraped from online sources, and collected into datasets like LAION-2B/COYO-700M/CommonCrawl. While these captions are typically not high quality, having billions of them do seem to mitigate this issue. When contrastive learning is used in this case, typically a dual encoder is used -- one for text, and one for the image. The network is trained using a loss which minimizes the distance between the correct text and image pair, while distances between incorrect text and image pairs are maximized. For example -- the caption \"A photo of a dog\" and the picture of the blue heeler puppy should have embeddings that are close, while the caption should be far away from a picture of a cat. Often times, normalized dot-product (cosine similarity), angular distance (Universal Sentence Encoder) euclidean distance, or squared euclidean distance are applied to compute the \"distance\" of the embeddings.\n",
