    "## What is contrastive learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrastive learning is often referred to as \"self-supervised learning (SSL)\" and has historically been known as \"metric learning.\" The essence of contrastive/metric learning is that instead of outputting a classification one-hot/softmax vector, or a regression value, you directly output a high-dimensional embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example: given multiple data points from a single class (for example, three photos of you from different viewpoints) and different classes (for example, 10 photos from one or multiple people who are not you), you want the three embeddings from your photos to be closer to each other while being farther away from the ten embeddings from the different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the name \"metric learning,\" where you seek to learn a metric/distance that fits the constraints of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why contrastive learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be immediately obvious why you would want to engage in contrastive or metric learning. Can't you just use a large 1000-class ImageNet-trained classifier to recognize every image? However, metric learning proves useful when the number of classes is not known ahead of time. For example, if you wanted a network to recognize human faces, there are approximately 7 billion people on this planet, making it impractical to train a classification network with 7 billion output neurons. Instead, you can train a network to output a high-dimensional embedding for each image. With this approach, given a reference image of a person, your network can determine if a new photo is similar to or different from the reference image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move forward, we'll employ PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) as our primary tools for visualizing data. These techniques are instrumental in reducing the dimensionality of the data, allowing us to observe patterns and relationships that are otherwise difficult to discern in high-dimensional spaces. By visualizing data in this way, we can gain insightful perspectives that are crucial for understanding complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mini residual block\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial focus will be on creating a mini_residual block. This block adopts a modern approach to the residual design, featuring a prenormalization step as suggested by Kaiming He. We will also incorporate the LeakyReLU activation function. LeakyReLU is particularly favored in generative adversarial networks (GANs) due to its ability to maintain non-zero gradients, which helps in the training process by avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. \n"

    "Now, let's move on to defining the loss function for our model using an approach derived from the PyTorch metric learning package for better clarity. We will implement a variant of the InfoNCE loss function, which is widely recognized as one of the most effective contrastive or metric learning losses. It has been prominently used in various models, including OpenAI's CLIP, due to its ability to enhance feature discrimination by contrasting positive pairs against negative pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, positive pairs refer to two data points that should be close together in embedding space. For example, two photos of you in different lighting conditions. On the other hand, negative pairs refer to two data points that should be far apart in embedding space, such as a photo of you versus a photo of a dog (assuming you are not a dog). Note that positive pairs and negative pairs do not have to be images. For instance, a picture and its corresponding text could also form a positive pair. Recent work has also explored defining positive pairs using an older version of the encoder, as seen in Google’s Momentum Contrast (MoCo) or EMA Contrastive methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "InfoNCE is one of the most common contrastive losses. It is essentially a cross-entropy loss used for classifying the correct positive pair from a pool of pairs. Variants like MIL-NCE allow for multiple positive pairs. This loss typically requires substantial batch sizes—commonly 128 or larger—to perform optimally. The need for large batch sizes stems from the necessity for diverse negative samples in the batch to effectively learn the contrasts. However, large batch sizes can be impractical in resource-constrained settings or when data availability is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we will implement a modified version of InfoNCE as described in the [\"Decoupled Contrastive Learning\"] (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19809-0_38) paper. This variant adapts the loss to be more suitable for smaller batch sizes by modifying the denominator of the InfoNCE formula. Specifically, it removes the positive example from the denominator, which reduces the computational demand and stabilizes training when fewer examples are available. This adjustment not only makes the loss function more flexible but also maintains robustness in learning discriminative features even with smaller batch sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what the default InfoNCE loss looks like. Note that prior to the dot product, the vectors are normalized to unit norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{L}_q = -\\log \\left( \\frac{\\exp(q \\cdot k_{+} / \\tau)}{\\sum_{i=0}^{K} \\exp(q \\cdot k_i / \\tau)} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal is to minimize the loss function. The numerator $ {\\exp(q \\cdot k_{+} / \\tau)} $ represents the similarity between the query and the positive key. By maximizing this term, the model learns to bring the positive pairs closer together in the embedding space. The denominator $ {\\sum_{i=0}^{K} \\exp(q \\cdot k_i / \\tau)} $ includes the similarities of the query with all other pairs (positive and negative). By normalizing with this sum, the model is encouraged to push the positive pairs closer together while pushing the negative pairs further apart. Essentially, we want the similarity of positive pairs to be higher relative to the similarity of all pairs. The Decoupled Contrastive Learning (DCL) loss modifies this slightly by removing the positive pair from the denominator, as detailed in their paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will create the PyTorch dataset object. This object defines how data is loaded from disk for each batch and what transformations are applied. It is important to note that you are not limited to using torchvision transforms; it is quite common to write custom transformation code within the dataset object."

    "## How is contrastive learning used in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2, CLIP, and their derivatives (including OpenCLIP and EVA-CLIP), are trained using contrastive losses. DINO and DINOv2 are trained solely on images, while CLIP is trained on a combination of images and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "When only images are used, the contrastive learning loss is applied to augmentations of the same image. These augmentations can include crops, flips, and rotations, and this approach is referred to as a \"pretext task.\" Typically, augmentations of the same image are treated as instances where the embeddings should be the same. For example, a network should recognize a photo of you and a photo of you flipped, with altered brightness, noise added, or converted to black and white, as representing the same person.\n",
    "\n",
    "When images and text are used together, as in CLIP, the training data consists of images and their corresponding captions. For example, the caption \"A photo of a dog\" might be paired with a picture of a blue heeler puppy. These captions are typically scraped from online sources and collected into datasets like LAION-2B, COYO-700M, and CommonCrawl. Although these captions are often of varying quality, the sheer volume of data helps to mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, contrastive learning typically employs a dual encoder system—one for text and one for images. The network is trained using a loss function that minimizes the distance between the correct text-image pairs while maximizing the distance between incorrect pairs. For example, the caption \"A photo of a dog\" should have embeddings close to the image of the blue heeler puppy and far from the image of a cat. To compute the \"distance\" of the embeddings, methods such as normalized dot-product (cosine similarity), angular distance (Universal Sentence Encoder), Euclidean distance, or squared Euclidean distance are often used."
