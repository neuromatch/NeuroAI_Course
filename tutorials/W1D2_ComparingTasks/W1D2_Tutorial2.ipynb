        "## Contrastive learning for object recognition\n",
        "##### Written by Andrew F. Luo under the guidance of Leila Wehbe in 2024\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is contrastive learning?\n",
        "Contrastive learning is often also known as \"self-supervised learning (SSL)\" and has historically been known as \"metric learning\". The essence of contrastive/metric learning is that instead of outputting a classification one-hot/softmax vector, or outputting a regression value -- you instead output an high dimensional embedding directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example: Given multiple data points from a single class (for example three photos of you for different viewpoints) and different class or classes (for example 10 photos, from one/multiple people who are not you) -- you want the three embeddings from your photos to be closer together to each other while being farther away from the ten embeddings from the different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence the name \"metric learning\", where you seek to learn a metric/distance that fits the constraints of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why contrastive learning?\n",
        "It may not be immediately obvious why you would want to do contrastive/metric learning. Can't you just use a giant 1000 class ImageNet trained classifier and recognize every image? However, metric learning is useful when the number of classes is not known ahead of time. For example, if I wanted a network to recognize human faces, however there are 7 billion people on this planet which makes it impossible for you to train a classification network with 7 billion output neurons. However, I can train a network that outputs a high dimensional embedding for each image. Now, given a reference image of a person, your network can decide if the new photo is close to or farther away from the reference image.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### How is contrastive learning used in practice?\n",
        "Nearly all vision foundation models (DINO and DINOv2, CLIP and all CLIP derivatives including OpenCLIP/EVA-CLIP) are trained using contrastive losses. DINO/v2 is trained on images alone, while CLIP is trained on a combination of images and text.\n",
        "\n",
        "When only images are used, the contrastive learning loss is applied to augmentations of the same image. Examples include crops/flips/rotations of images -- when used in the way, the augmentations are called a \"pretext task\". Typically, augmentations of the same image are treated as instances where the embeddings should be the same. So for example, a network should recognize a photo of you, and a photo of you flipped (or brightness changed, or noise added, or changed to black and white) as a photo of the same person.\n",
        "\n",
        "When images and text are used together as in CLIP, you have images and captions of those images -- for example the caption \"A photo of a dog\" may be matched to a picture of a blue heeler puppy. These captions are typicalled scraped from online sources, and collected into datasets like LAION-2B/COYO-700M/CommonCrawl. While these captions are typically not high quality, having billions of them do seem to mitigate this issue. When contrastive learning is used in this case, typically a dual encoder is used -- one for text, and one for the image. The network is trained using a loss which minimizes the distance between the correct text and image pair, while distances between incorrect text and image pairs are maximized. For example -- the caption \"A photo of a dog\" and the picture of the blue heeler puppy should have embeddings that are close, while the caption should be far away from a picture of a cat. Often times, normalized dot-product (cosine similarity), angular distance (Universal Sentence Encoder\n",
        ",) euclidean distance, or squared euclidean distance are applied to compute the \"distance\" of the embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Terms defined and other stuff\n",
        "* Positive pair -- This means two data points that should be close together in embedding space. For example two photos of you in different lighting conditions\n",
        "* Negative pair -- This means two data points that should be far away in embedding space. For example, a photo of you versus a photo of a dog (assuming you are not a dog). Note that positive pairs/negative pairs don't have to be images. You could have a picture and the matching text be a positive pair as well. Recent work has also moved to positive pairs defined using an older version of the encoder (Google Momentum contrast or EMA contrastive)\n",
        "* Pretext task -- In computer vision, this refers to how you augment images to get positive pairs.\n",
        "* Hard positive/negative mining -- This refers to a practice where positive/negative pairs where the network struggles are used to trained the network with more loss in some way.\n",
        "* InfoNCE -- This is one of the most common contrastive losses [1,2,3,4] which was proposed in similar ways multiple times by different authors. It is a cross-entropy loss of classifying\n",
        "the correct positive pair out froma pool of pairs. Note there are variants like MIL-NCE which allow for multiple positive pairs.\n",
        "* Recommended reading: \"A Metric Learning Reality Check\" -- This paper shows that most contrastive/metric learning losses perform very similarly\n",
