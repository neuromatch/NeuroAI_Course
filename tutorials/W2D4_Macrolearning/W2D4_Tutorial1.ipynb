    "In this tutorial, we will explore the problems that come from *distribution shifts*. Distribution shifts occur the testing data distribution strays from training data distribution; that is, when a model is evaluated on data that somehow differs from what it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways that testing data can differ from training data. Two broad categories of distribution shifts are: **covariate shift** and **concept shift**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first, the distribution of input features changes. For example, consider a dog/cat classification task where the model was trained to differentiate between real-photos of pets while the testing dataset consists fully of cartoon characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, as it name suggests, is more of the conceptual change in the relationship between features and desired output. For example, the recommendation system may learn a users preferences, but then those preferences change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore both types of shifts on a simple function which represents the relationship between day of the year and price for the fruits in the local market."
