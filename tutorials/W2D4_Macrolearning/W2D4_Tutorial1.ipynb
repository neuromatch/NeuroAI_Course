    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the problems that arise from *distribution shifts*. Distribution shifts occur when the testing data distribution deviates from the training data distribution; that is, when a model is evaluated on data that somehow differs from what it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways that testing data can differ from training data. Two broad categories of distribution shifts are: **covariate shift** and **concept shift**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In covariate shift, the distribution of input features changes. For example, consider a dog/cat classification task where the model was trained to differentiate between real photos of pets while the testing dataset consists entirely of cartoon characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept shift, as its name suggests, involves a conceptual change in the relationship between features and the desired output. For example, a recommendation system may learn a user's preferences, but then those preferences change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore both types of shifts using a simple function that represents the relationship between the day of the year and the price of fruits in the local market!"
