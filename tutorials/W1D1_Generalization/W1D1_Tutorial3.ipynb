    "*Estimated timing of tutorial: 30 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to generalization in the context of cognitive science. We'll close the loop of our exploration of different views of handwriting with a model that combines aspects of the models we covered in the neuroscience and AI tutorials, including both generative and discriminative components. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we'll be looking at the Omniglot dataset, and how it can be used to infer how humans and machines generalize in a handwritten symbol recognition task. We'll try our hand at one-shot learning, and we'll measure our sample complexity. We'll then discuss how one cognitive model, [Feinman and Lake](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14448) (2020), attempts to solve the problem of handwritten symbol recognition using a neuro-symbolic method. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, participants will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore the goals of cognitive science. Understand the aims of cognitive science such as unraveling the complexities of human cognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define one-shot learning and sample complexity. Perform a task that involves one-shot learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explore how a neurosymbolic model with strong inductive biases could explain one-shot learning on Omniglot."

    "Let's put ourselves in the mindset of a cognitive scientist studying handwriting. We're interested in how people learn to recognize new characters. Indeed, humans display low **sample complexity** when learning new visual concepts: they seem to grasp new concepts with very few presentations, generalizing effortlessly. In AI, learning from $k$ labeled examples is known as $k$-shot learning; one-shot and few-shot learning refer to learning from one or a few labeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good dataset to investigate one-shot learning is the Omniglot dataset. Omniglot has sometimes been described as *MNIST, transposed*. Instead of **thousands** of examples from **10** digit classes, Omniglot consists of **20** instances from **1623** character classes. These character classes are sourced from 50 alphabets, both natural (e.g. Cherokee or Greek) and constructed (e.g. the alien alphabet from the TV show Futurama). \n",
