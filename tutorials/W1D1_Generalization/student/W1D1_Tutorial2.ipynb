    "\n",
    "*Estimated timing of tutorial: 75 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to generalization in neuroscience. We'll look at a classic neuroscience paper, [Sussillo et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4042), that compares how artificial and biological neural networks solve different motor tasks. This paper looks at how linear arm movements are generated in motor cortex; later extensions of these ideas (e.g. [Codol et al. 2024](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/88591v2); [Almani et al. 2024](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=x-YACVoAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=x-YACVoAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC)) address how more complex skilled movements, including handwriting, can be generated, continuing our theme for today's tutorials. We'll look at a popular AI-derived framework for understanding how the brain solves tasks: task-driven neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our learning goals for this tutorial are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand core goals in neuroscience. Examine the fundamental questions that drive neuroscience research, such as the 'What', 'How', and 'Why' behind neurological functions and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conceptualize generalization in neuroscience. Gain insights into what generalization entails within the field of neuroscience, understanding how principles of neural generalization can inform and be informed by artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluate the impact of architectural choices. Discuss how different architectural decisions and the selection of priors in model design can introduce inductive biases, affecting the generalization capabilities of both neural and artificial systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Illustrate robustness in noisy environments. Identify and describe real-world instances where the pursuit of robustness against noise has led to converging strategies in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

    "Our neuroscientist is trying to address a *how* question: how does the brain find solutions to complex control problems that generalize? Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a type of artificial neural network, have proven a very useful tool to address these *how* questions. They mimic the adaptability and plasticity observed in biological neural networks through interconnected artificial neurons, weights dictating connection strengths, and activation functions triggering neuron responses. **Task-driven neural networks** are trained *in silico* to solve similar tasks to ones that the brain must solve. Properly constrained, they often find solutions to problems that are similar to the ones that the brain seems to find. The trained artificial neural networks can then be used to investigate, mechanistically, how a task is solved. "

    "The previous network found complicated solutions to the problem of generating muscle activity: the hidden activity of the network wasn't matched to what we see in real neurons. We'd like to obtain more **naturalistic solutions** that better match the brain by regularizing this network. Later, we'll test this regularized network for robustness and generalization to see if this also affects the network's ability to extrapolate beyond its training data.\n",

    "* Neuroscientists often aim to uncover *how* the brain performs a task.\n",
    "* Artificial neural networks are a useful tool for investigating how a computation might be performed.\n",
    "  * We often care about biological plausibility: the operations performed by the network should roughly match those that the brain can perform. For instance, while RNNs have been surpassed by transformers for natural language processing, they remain popular in neuroscience.\n",
    "* Neuroscientists often care about whether a model generalizes across circumstances that an organism might face.\n",
    "  * We tested robustness to noise (e.g. neural noise) and robustness to weight changes (e.g. rollover in synapses) across different models and found regularized models offered a useful **inductive bias** which generalized better.\n",
    "* The tools to improve generalization in task-driven neural networks are similar to the ones used in AI more generally: regularization, augmentations, but also potentially pretraining the model and transfer learning.\n",
    "* Networks that perform similar tasks to the brain and generalize well *sometimes* converge to similar solutions to the brain. We don't fully understand this phenomenon, and we'll introduce tools throughout the course to more quantitatively assess the correspondence."
