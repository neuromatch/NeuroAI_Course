    "In this tutorial, you will learn about normative models of synaptic plasticity. Normative models of synaptic plasticity are learning rules for parameters in neural networks that have two important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * They optimize global objective functions that define behavioral/perceptual goals for an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Unlike learning algorithms like backpropagation, they demonstrate how learning is 'local', i.e. it uses only information that could conceivably be available to a single synapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two features together make such learning algorithms good candidate models for how learning could work in the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Relate local plasticity rules to estimates of loss gradients.\n",
    "* Understand the impact of variance and bias in gradient estimators and how they affect the scalability, performance, and generalization capabilities of learning algorithms.\n",
    "* Implement 2-3 learning rules in toy tasks.\n",
    "* Describe issues with biological plausibility in some learning algorithms, most notably, weight transport."

    "In this first section, we will be deriving and implementing the __Weight Perturbation__ algorithm. In the next section, we will be deriving and implementing the __Node Perturbation__ algorithm. Both of these methods of gradient estimation are very closely related to *finite differences* derivative approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    " Suppose that we have some loss function, $\\loss(\\Delta \\weight)$, which we would like to minimize by making some change in our synaptic weights, $\\Delta \\weight$. The most natural way to decrease the loss would be to perform gradient descent; however, it is not reasonable to assume that a synapse in the brain could perform analytic gradient calculations for general loss functions $\\loss(\\Delta \\weight)$, which may depend on the activity of many downstream neurons and the external environment. Biological systems could solve this problem by *approximating* the gradient of the loss, which could be accomplished in many ways. \n",
    " \n",
    " To start, we will provide the __weight perturbation__ update, and will subsequently demonstrate why it provides an estimate of the gradient. We will first add noise to our weights, using $\\weight' = \\weight + \\noisew$, where $\\noisew \\sim \\mathcal N(0, \\sigma^2)$. We take as our update:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "First, we will clarify why this parameter update is interesting from a neuroscientific perspective. If we look at the parameter update for a *single synapse*, $\\weight_{ij}$, we have:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\Delta \\weight_{ij} &=  - \\eta \\mathbb{E}_{\\noisew} \\left [\\left (\\loss(\\noisew) - \\loss(0)\\right ) \\frac{(\\weight'_{ij} - \\weight_{ij})}{\\sigma^2} \\right ] \\\\\n",
    "    & \\approx  - \\eta \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{k = 0}^K\\left [\\left (\\loss(\\noisew^{(k)}) - \\loss(0)\\right ) \\frac{(\\weight'^{(k)}_{ij} - \\weight_{ij})}{\\sigma^2} \\right ],\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where for the last approximate equality we are substituting an expectation over $\\noisew$ for an empirical approximation over $K$ samples of $\\noisew$. This update only requires information about the global loss, $\\loss(\\noisew^{(k)})$ and the local parameter values, $\\weight'^{(k)}_{ij}$: using this update, a synapse in a neural network can adapt its strength with *very little* information about what is going on in the rest of the neural circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will show why this update is an approximation of the loss gradient: this section is only to satisfy your curiosity, and is not necessary for completing the coding exercises. We first notice that by first-order Taylor expansion $\\loss(\\noisew) \\approx \\loss(0) + \\derivative{\\loss}{\\weight}\\T \\noisew$. Plugging this approximation into our update equation, we get:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\Delta \\weight_{ij} &=  - \\eta \\mathbb{E}_{\\noisew} \\left [\\left (\\derivative{\\loss}{\\weight}\\T \\noisew\\right ) \\frac{\\noisew_{ij}}{\\sigma^2} \\right ] \\\\\n",
    "    &=  - \\eta \\derivative{\\loss}{\\weight_{ij}},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where this last equality follows from the fact that $\\mathbb{E}_{\\noisew} \\left[\\noisew_{ij} \\noisew_{kl} \\right] = \\sigma^2$ if and only if $i = k$ and $j = l$, and is 0 otherwise. Therefore, in expectation over many noise samples $\\noisew$, our parameter update based purely on measuring how perturbations of the weights $\\weight'$ correlate with changes in the loss function $\\loss(\\noisew)$, ends up being an unbiased approximation of gradient descent.\n"

    "While we can get an unbiased derivative approximation based solely on perturbations of the weights, we will show later on that this is actually a very inefficient method, because it requires averaging out $MN$ noise sources, where $M$ is the dimension of the input $\\stim$ and $N$ is the dimension of the hidden activity $\\rate$. \n",

    "For simplicity, consider what happens in a network with a linear hidden layer. If we add noise at the level of the hidden units $\\rate = \\weight \\stim$, we will only have to average over $N$ noise sources. To do this, we can use the following update, taking $\\rate' = \\rate + \\noiser$, where $\\noiser \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$:\n",

    "We will now show why this update is interesting from a neuroscience perspective (for much the same reason as for weight perturbation). For a single synapse, the approximate update using samples of $\\noiser$ is given by:\n",

    "Once again this update requires very little knowledge about the rest of the neural circuit in order for a synapse to compute it. It requires knowledge of the global loss, $\\loss(\\noiser^{(k)})$, postsynaptic activity $\\rate^{(k)}_i$, and presynaptic activity $\\stim_j$. This form of parameter update is often called a Reward (loss)-modulated Hebbian plasticity rule, or a 3-factor plasticity rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will show why this update is an unbiased gradient estimate: again, this section is only to satisfy your curiosity, and is not needed for the coding exercises. We again employ a first-order Taylor expansion: $\\loss(\\noiser) \\approx \\loss(0) + \\derivative{\\loss}{\\rate}\\T\\noiser$, to get:\n",

This analysis shows that we can estimate derivatives by correlating fluctuations in either $\\weight$ *or* $\\rate$ with fluctuations in the loss function. Neither strategy requires evaluating derivatives of $\\blackbox(\\cdot)$, they only require some extrinsic measure of performance, given by $\\mathcal{L}$ and how performance varies in response to perturbations in either weights or nodes, respectively. In subsequent sections, we will investigate how these different methods compare in terms of their ability to estimate gradients in systems with large numbers of neurons. We will show that there is no free lunch--though these methods require less information, they are less *efficient* than analytic gradient calculations."

    "\n",
    "One important detail: there are two different notions of efficiency we could consider here: 1) sample efficiency and 2) runtime efficiency. Node perturbation is more sample efficient: in general it brings the loss lower with fewer samples than weight perturbation. However, our particular implementation of node perturbation runs a little slower than weight perturbation, so you could argue that it has worse runtime efficiency. This is just due to the fact that these algorithms were implemented by different people, and the author for node perturbation exploited python parallel computation a little less effectively."

As such, node perturbation will scale better as the number of inputs or the number of neurons in the network increases, while weight perturbation will do worse. As we will see below, neither of these methods will scale as well as backpropagation. Becoming less effective at scale is a major problem for a learning algorithm operating in the brain, where synaptic modifications may occur in billions of neurons, and potentially trillions of synapses."

For the purposes of comparing gradient estimates, the SNR is a superior measure compared to the variance, because it is *scale invariant*: while the variance scales quadratically if the gradient estimate is multiplied by a scalar $\\eta$ (for instance a learning rate), the SNR remains unchanged! This means that we will be able to meaningfully compare gradient updates that are of different sizes, and will prevent algorithms with smaller gradient updates from appearing spuriously low-noise."

Like the SNR, the cosine similarity measure is also *scale invariant*, so multiplying $\\Delta \\theta_1$ by a constant (e.g. a learning rate) will not change the cosine similarity at all. We care about parameter updates pointing in the same *direction* as the gradient, but for our purposes, it does not really matter if the update is greater or lesser in magnitude, because we can always decrease or increase the learning rate. For this reason, using a scale invariant measure of alignment is advantageous, because it ignores magnitudes.\n",
