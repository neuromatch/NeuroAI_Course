    "It is highly encourage (borderline mandatory :p) that you stick to python packages that are easily installable using pip. If you need to install obscure supporting libraries, or specific verions of C compilers, this will cause you (and us) more headaches than necessary. If you want to use some obscure package, please try not to, or find another way to include the functionality of the desired package.\n",

    "It is also strongly advised that you decide on a pythong version for the book, stick to it, and make sure that all of your content creators are using the same version. Mixing python versions will also create a lot of headaches. What ever version you decide on, be sure to specify that in the github workflows. This template is using python 3.9.\n",
