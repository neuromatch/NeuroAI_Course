Discussion: How would you explain the usage of `d,md->m` in `np.einsum()` function in the previous coding exercise?

`d` is the dimensionality of the vector; we compute the similarity of one vector (representing `0` object) with other `m` vectors of the same dimension `d` (thus `md`); as a result, we receive `m` values of similarity.
