# Suggested further readings 

We've come to the end of today's session, and briefly covered what is a very well researched field. There is a lot of research into Vector Symbolic Algebras, including algebras that we did not present today, and it is a field that is starting to garner more interest.

To read more about how VSAs can be used to model brains, Chris' book is a good place to start:

> Eliasmith, Chris. [How to build a brain: A neural architecture for biological cognition.](https://academic.oup.com/book/6263) OUP USA, 2013.

If you'd like more detail about fractional binding and how SSPs are related to Grid and Place Cells the following papers from the lab cover this topic:

> Komer, Brent, et al. ["A neural representation of continuous space using fractional binding."](https://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/komer.2019.pdf) CogSci. 2019.

> Dumont, Nicole, and Chris Eliasmith. ["Accurate representation for spatial cognition using grid cells."](https://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/dumont.2020.pdf) CogSci. 2020.

> Dumont, Nicole Sandra-Yaffa, et al. ["Biologically-Based Computation: How Neural Details and Dynamics Are Suited for Implementing a Variety of Algorithms."](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/13/2/245) Brain Sciences 13.2 (2023): 245.

To learn more about probability modelling and VSAs, check out this paper:

> Furlong, P. Michael, and Chris Eliasmith. ["Modelling neural probabilistic computation using vector symbolic architectures."](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-023-10031-7) Cognitive Neurodynamics (2023): 1-24.

You can find more papers that show the link between the Neurosymbolic representations and models of the brain at [our lab's website](https://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications.html).

If you'd like to read more about the Holographic Reduced Representations, the algebra we used in this work, a great place to start is Tony Plate's book, which summarizes a considerable amout of Dr.Plate's early research:

> Plate, Tony A. [Holographic Reduced Representation: Distributed representation for cognitive structures.](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/H/bo3643252.html) Vol. 150. Stanford: CSLI Publications, 2003.

Another excellent introductory work is from Pentti Kanerva, which is where the "What is the dollar of Mexico?" example came from:

> Kanerva, Pentti. ["Hyperdimensional computing: An introduction to computing in distributed representation with high-dimensional random vectors."](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-009-9009-8) Cognitive computation 1 (2009): 139-159.

There is also a 2-part survey about VSAs more generally that is good for those new to the field:

> Kleyko, Denis, et al. ["A survey on hyperdimensional computing aka vector symbolic architectures, part i: Models and data transformations."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06077) ACM Computing Surveys 55.6 (2022): 1-40.
