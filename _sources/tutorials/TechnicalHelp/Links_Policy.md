## Policies

### Coursework attendance policy

Students who participate in this course will gain a certificate of completion for the coursework. Students are allowed to miss two days if necessary and if they communicate that with their teaching assistant. If there are exceptional circumstances that force a student to miss class for reasons completely beyond their control, such as severe illness, electricity blackouts, etc, they can request to get the certificate despite missing more than two days by filling out the Attendance Waiver ([https://airtable.com/appQ20RmRMNxUVUTd/shrKlQX3PHW8OcTtg](https://airtable.com/appQ20RmRMNxUVUTd/shrKlQX3PHW8OcTtg)) **at least two days prior to the end of course**. Please note these requests may not be granted.

### Projects attendance policy

Projects are an integral part of the Neuromatch Academy experience. Students who participate in projects and miss no more than two days of projects work will gain a certificate of completion for the projects. 

If the student participates in projects but misses more than two days due to exceptional circumstances, they can request to get the projects certificate anyway by filling out the Attendance Waiver ([https://airtable.com/appQ20RmRMNxUVUTd/shrKlQX3PHW8OcTtg](https://airtable.com/appQ20RmRMNxUVUTd/shrKlQX3PHW8OcTtg)) **at least two days prior to the end of course**. Please note these requests may not be granted.
