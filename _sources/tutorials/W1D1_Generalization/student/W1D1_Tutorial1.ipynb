    "# Tutorial Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "*Estimated timing of tutorial: 75 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to generalization in the context of modern AI systems. We'll look at a particular system trained for handwriting recognition–TrOCR. We'll review what makes that model tick–the transformer architecture–and explore what goes on into training and finetuning large-scale models. We'll look at how augmentations can bake in tolerance to certain transformations like scaling and cropping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our learning objectives for today are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify and articulate common objectives pursued by developers of operational AI systems, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OOD robustness; Latency; Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C)\n",
    "- Explainability and understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain at least three strategies for enhancing the generalization capabilities of AI systems, including the contemporary trend of training generic large-scale models on extensive datasets, commonly referred to as the [\"bitter lesson.\"]((http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gain practical experience with the fundamentals of deep learning and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: this tutorial leverages GPU acceleration. Using a GPU runtime in colab will make the the tutorial run 10x faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"

    "\n",
    "Transformers are built on self-attention, allowing them to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data differently. This has proven useful for tasks that require an understanding of context, such as language translation, text summarization, and, as we will see, optical character recognition. Some key components of transformers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization: the input sequence (e.g. sentence) is split into different components (e.g. word pieces). Each component, or token, is embedded into a fixed dimensional space. In natural language processing, tokenization is done via a lookup table: every word piece is mapped to a fixed-dimensional vector. [See W3D1 of the DL course for a refresher on tokenization](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W3D1_TimeSeriesAndNaturalLanguageProcessing/student/W3D1_Tutorial2.html?highlight=word2vec#tokenizers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self-attention: A self-attention mechanism allows the tokens in the sequence to interact to form new representations. Specifically, queries and keys are derived from tokens; an inner product between queries and keys, followed by a softmax, forms the attention matrix. The attention matrix is multiplied by the value matrix to obtain a new representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positional encoding: Positional encoding is added to the input to give the model information about the position of each token within the sequence. Unlike RNNs or CNNs, transformers **do not process data in order–without position encoding, they are permutation invariant**. We'll dig deeper into what this implies in the section on the inductive biases of transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Layer Normalization and Residual Connections are used within the transformer architecture to stabilize the learning process and improve the model's ability to learn deep representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of transformers over previous architectures is a high degree of parallelism, which allows one to train larger, more capable models. Let's inspect TrOCR's architecture."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We train models to minimize a loss function. Oftentimes, however, what we care about is something different, like how well the model will generalize when it's deployed. Our intrepid developer got a rude awakening when comparing the OOD robustness of the model to its empirical loss on the train set: the character error rate was several times larger than expected. Motivated by other factors, like engineering complexity, our developer decided to move forward and deploy a handwriting transcription system, hoping it could be fine-tuned based on users' data later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot that goes into the training of robust AI models that generalize well. Generic high-capacity models with weak inductive biases, like transformers, are trained on large-scale data. Pretraining, augmentations, and synthetic data can all be part of the recipe for learning structure that might be hard to express mathematically, such as the fact that text is written left to right. Because large-scale models can often require a significant amount of computation to train, in practice, models that have been trained for other purposes are adapted and re-used, preventing the need to learn from scratch. These models embody what's known as [\"the bitter lesson\"](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html): general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin."
