    "## Reinforcement learning review\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm where an agent interacts with an environment and learns a policy to maximize its cumulative rewards. We focus here on a simple environment: a binary \"two-armed bandit\" (Figure A), a name for a gambling machine found in casinos (because it steals your money). In this task, at each opportunity, the agent chooses arm $i$ (either Left $L$ or Right $R$) and gets a reward with probability $p_i$ that is unknown to the agent. On each trial, only one of the arms will return a reward, so $p_L + p_R = 1$ (which the agent does know).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/neuromatch/NeuroAI_Course/blob/main/tutorials/W1D2_ComparingTasks/static/two_armed_bandit.png?raw=true\" width=600 />\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure A. Example of binary bandit. The left arm has a probability $p_L$ of giving a reward, and the right arm a probability $p_R = 1-p_L$ of giving a reward. At a given trial, the agent pulls one of the arms and receives a reward with the corresponding probability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward over a series of trials (e.g., 100 trials). This would correspond to correctly identifying the arm that returns more reward (has a higher probability) and choosing it for subsequent trials once it's sure about its choice. Thus, while solving this problem, the agent will need to balance exploration and exploitation. At a high level, more exploration is useful when the agent is not certain of which arm has more reward, and once the agent is more certain, it is more advantageous to exploit the arm that has a higher probability of reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different methods are used to solve this problem. An optimal method to solve some instances of bandit problems is [Gittin indices](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rrw1/oc/ocgittins.pdf). This method incorporates the estimated rewards and their uncertainty, and involves solving an expensive dynamical programming problem. The simplest method is [epsilon greedy](https://medium.com/@ym1942/exploring-multi-armed-bandit-problem-epsilon-greedy-epsilon-decreasing-ucb-and-thompson-02ad0ec272ee), where exploration and exploitation are balanced by choosing a random action with probability $\\epsilon$ and the best known action with probability $1-\\epsilon$. In the [Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)](https://medium.com/@ym1942/exploring-multi-armed-bandit-problem-epsilon-greedy-epsilon-decreasing-ucb-and-thompson-02ad0ec272ee), the choice of action also incorporates both the estimated rewards and the estimated uncertainty of the rewards. In [Thompson sampling](https://medium.com/@ym1942/exploring-multi-armed-bandit-problem-epsilon-greedy-epsilon-decreasing-ucb-and-thompson-02ad0ec272ee), the choice is made according to a Bayesian model that estimates the posterior probabilities of the reward."

During training, the agent is exposed to different episodes with different environments and gains meta-learning strategies. At deployment, the agent is faced with a new environment and uses the trials from that episode (the combination of actions, states and rewards) to learn a policy on the fly. Meta-RL algorithms are typically implemented using a deep learning architecture such as an LSTM. Once they are trained, the weights of the LSTM are fixed. When faced with a new episode, the activations in the LSTM implement nested learning in which the algorithm identifies the best arm for this specific episode."

    "This paper aims to reconcile two seemingly disparate ideas about learning in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The activations in the PFC are correlated to actions, values and rewards, indicating that the PFC is engaged in RL. Another set of findings, including the fact that PFC activity is correlated with the recent history of rewards and actions, also suggests that the PFC is acting as a meta-RL agent. The paper proposes a meta-RL model, the weights of which are optimized during training to allow it to learn a second RL algorithm dynamically, as the properties of the environment change. They demonstrate a close match between findings in the neuroscience literature on the PFC and their trained RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning at different time scales\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore here the demo in Figure 1 of the paper. Figure C below shows the architecture of the meta-RL model, which is implemented as an LSTM. We will explore how, after training, the weights of the LSTM implement an RL procedure (e.g., we will see if this procedure deals with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff).\n",

    "We will also explore how learning can occur at different time scales (see figure B below):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latent world state (fast)**: In this demo, at the start of each episode, a new set of probabilities $p_L$ and $p_R = 1-p_L$ are sampled. This corresponds to latent world state parameters that change on a slower time scale than the observations level (i.e., trials), but still at a relatively fast scale (each episode here has 100 trials).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context (slow)**: We think of the context level as a slower time scale at which the world is changing and affecting how the parameters of the latent world state are sampled. In this paper, the authors train their meta-RL model in two contexts. In the first (independent bandit context), the parameters of the successive latent world state (i.e., $p_L$ and $p_R$ from two successive episodes) are not correlated. There is no specific knowledge about the parameters that can be generalized from one episode to the next. In the second (correlated bandit context), the parameters are anti-correlated, similar to the scenario we explored in the last section with the UCB algorithm. Long-time scale integration can be leveraged for faster learning in the next episode. We will explore how training in these two different contexts affects performance."

    "In this tutorial, we examined how reinforcement learning can be adapted and scaled across different temporal dimensions, particularly focusing on meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) frameworks. We explored the concept of \"learning to learn,\" where an algorithm adjusts its strategy based on accumulated knowledge from varied episodes, rather than from static training. This approach is important when dealing with dynamic environments or when the agent is introduced to novel scenarios not covered during initial training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on the binary bandit setup, where an agent decides between two options, balancing exploration (gathering information) and exploitation (leveraging known information for rewards). We showed the mechanics of one classic bandit strategy, the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. We showed it could solve a static bandit task, but struggled when the environment changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivated our discussion of meta-RL, where the agent is trained across episodes with varying conditions, thereby learning a flexible policy that can quickly adapt to new environments. The tutorial wrapped up by linking these learning processes to neural mechanisms, offering a bridge between artificial intelligence and neuroscientific understandings of learning."
