# Useful tips for Students

I’m a student, how can I make the most out of my mentoring experience?

**Enthusiasm to the max**: mentoring is a learning and networking opportunity. You may find someone to look up to, to collaborate with, or just from which to draw off more passion to follow your path in academia or industry.

**Program the meeting and work agile**: you might want to have a rough drawing of what you'll be discussing during the meeting, i.e., how to apply to grad school, lab experience, and networking. This will enable you to have a program, leaving less space for improvisation. Be also prepared to adapt to change, because you'll not be alone in the room and discussion may evolve based on other people's inputs.

**Self-knowledge**: you are not expected to know everything about your professional interests, but you should have a clear picture of where you are at the moment. This will help you get the best advice possible from your mentor. During the first meeting, introduce yourself, and reflect on your current career and your plans. Define realistic targets and implement a program to achieve them, with the help of your mentor and your peers.

**Take notes and work hard**: take notes during or after the meeting to save what has been said. Try to elaborate and work on the suggestions you received so that when you meet up again, you can provide some advances to your mentor and peers.

**Own your actions**: a mentor is there to guide you, but not to solve your problems. Help might come just as verbal advice. In other cases, they might give you resources like books, papers or institutes to contact. Don't be afraid to ask, but in the end, you must take action based on this advice, your interests, and your capabilities.

**Keep a respectful conversation**: mentoring is a social interaction. You may construct a long-lasting relationship with your mentor and your peers. Thus, be kind and have fun, as you’ll be discussing your dreams and career goals, as well as the efforts you’ve made so far to follow them.
